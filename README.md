# MLB Game Score Automation Pipeline

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project presents a **robust, automated Python pipeline** designed to scrape daily MLB (Major League Baseball) game scores and matchups directly from [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/). The collected data is then seamlessly uploaded to a designated Google Sheet, providing a real-time, shareable, and structured dataset for sports analytics, trend tracking, and historical review.

This pipeline exemplifies advanced data mining capabilities, including targeted web scraping, data structuring, and integration with cloud services, making it an ideal solution for clients requiring up-to-date sports data for various analytical purposes.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Capabilities

Based on the provided output and common sports data needs, this pipeline offers:

* **Automated Daily Game Score Collection:** Efficiently scrapes daily MLB schedules, extracting game scores and team matchups for specified dates or recent periods.
* **Targeted Web Scraping:** Leverages `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` to intelligently navigate and extract precise data points from complex sports statistics websites (e.g., `baseball-reference.com`).
* **Google Sheets Integration:** Automatically authenticates with the Google Sheets API, creates (if non-existent) and updates a dedicated spreadsheet with the scraped data.
* **Real-time Data Sharing:** Provides a shareable URL to the Google Sheet upon successful upload, enabling instant access to the collected data for team members or further analysis.
* **Structured Output:** Organizes scraped data into clear, readable formats within the Google Sheet, ready for immediate use.
* **Robust Logging:** Comprehensive `INFO` level logging provides detailed insights into the scraping process, including URL fetches, data points collected, and Google Sheets operations.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Easily customizable via `config.json` for spreadsheet naming, scraping years, and other settings.

## üìà Pipeline Output & Demonstrative Results

The `run_scraper.py` script executes the full pipeline, providing detailed console output and uploading the results directly to Google Sheets.

### Google Sheets Output Example:

The scraped data (game scores, teams) is uploaded to a Google Sheet. A sample screenshot or a link to a *read-only public example* of the Google Sheet would be highly beneficial here.

**Example Sheet Structure (Screenshot/Description):**

**Sheet Name:** `Scores`
**Columns:** `Date`, `Away_Team`, `Away_Score`, `Home_Team`, `Home_Score`

| Date         | Away_Team         | Away_Score | Home_Team           | Home_Score |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :------------------ | :--------- |

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.7+** installed.
2.  **Google Cloud Project & Service Account:**
    * Enable the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API for your project.
    * Create a **Service Account** and download its JSON key file (usually named `your-project-name-xyz123.json`). Rename this file to `credentials.json`.
    * Ensure the service account's email address has **Editor access** to the Google Sheet you intend to use. If the sheet doesn't exist, the script will create it, and the service account will automatically be its owner.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/MLB-Game-Score-Automation.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/MLB-Game-Score-Automation.git)
    cd MLB-Game-Score-Automation
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(A `requirements.txt` file listing `pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `gspread`, `oauth2client`, `lxml`, `python-dateutil`, `pytz` should be present in the repo.)*

3.  **Add your Google Sheets credentials:**
    * Place your `credentials.json` file (downloaded from Google Cloud Console) in the same directory as `run_scraper.py`. **Ensure this file is listed in `.gitignore` and is NOT committed to your public repository!**

4.  **Customize the configuration:**
    * Edit `config.json` to set your preferred Google Sheet name (e.g., `"spreadsheet_name": "MLB Data Analysis - Upwork Demo"`).
    * You can also adjust other scraping parameters like the target year for the schedule.

### Usage

**To scrape recent games and upload data to Google Sheets:**

```bash
python run_scraper.py
The script will automatically:

Initialize the Google Sheets client.

Fetch the MLB schedule for the specified year.

Identify recent game scores.

Upload the collected scores to the designated Google Sheet.

Print a shareable URL to the updated Google Sheet in the console.
```
